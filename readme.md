# GoHighLevel Documentation
This repo is for internal documentation on usage for our GoHighLevel solution.

## Making Changes
While developing run the command:
`mkdocs serve --livereload`
to work on the documentation with live reloading on saving files.

## Commiting Changes
First commit changes to the main then run
`mkdocs gh-deploy`
Mkdocs will automatically build and publish to the gh-pages branch.
After a minute GitHub will complete page building and make it live.
Note: During the building process the docs will be down.
